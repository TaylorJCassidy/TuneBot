# TuneBot

A Discord YouTube streaming bot.

To add this bot to your own Discord server, click [here](TBC).

## Running Locally

### First Time Setup
In order to run this bot locally, you will need a Discord bot token, which you can generate yourself [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications). Replace `YOUR-TOKEN-HERE` within [`.env.sample`](.env.sample) with the token you have generated. Then rename this file to remove the '.sample', leaving you with a file named `.env`. The other fields within the `.env` file are optional.

Next, you will have to install the dependencies through npm. Open a terminal window within this directory and type `npm install`.

### Starting
Once the above has been completed, to start the bot open a terminal window within this directory and type `npm start`.
